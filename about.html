      <h2>What’s Broken</h2>
      <p>The influencing world runs on exposure — but rarely offers ownership.</p>
      <p>You make the product desirable, but you don’t share in what it earns.</p>
      <p>You’re handed a brief, not a stake. A contract, not a vision.</p>
      <p>Trends move fast. Loyalty is shallow. Creators are replaceable.</p>
      <p>You’re expected to perform — not participate.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What We’re Changing</h2>
      <p>MODELS Inc flips the model.</p>
      <p>You don’t promote what you didn’t help shape.</p>
      <p>You co-create brands from the start — and you own a part of what you build.</p>
      <p>We slow things down. Prioritise intention over output.</p>
      <p>And give you real space to move, contribute, and build legacy — not just content.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What We Are</h2>
      <p>MODELS Inc. is a private collective where influence meets ownership.</p>
      <p>We partner with a handpicked group of like-minded creators — not to just promote brands, but to co-found them.</p>
      <p>You don’t pay to join. You’re brought in as a co-founder.</p>
      <p>You gain equity, creative direction, and a seat at the table.</p>
      <p>This is about building brands that resonate with you — with real meaning and long-term value.</p>
      <p>Our first brand, Beau, is already in motion — a sculptural bottle reimagining wellness as ritual.</p>
      <p>And it’s just the beginning.</p>
      <p>MODELS Inc. is where influence becomes ownership.</p>
      <p>Where influencers get investment, and investment gets influence.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <p>You’ve built communities, defined aesthetics, and shaped culture.</p>
      <p>That kind of influence is capital — and you deserve a stake in what it creates.</p>
      <p>We believe your value goes beyond promotion. You deserve ownership.</p>
      <p>MODELS Inc is built on shared vision and the belief that the next generation of brands will be created with you — not on top of you.</p>
      <p>This isn’t just a platform to support.</p>
      <p>It’s one you can stand on.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What We Build</h2>
      <p>MODELS Inc builds brands — but not just any brands.</p>
      <p>We create products, systems, and rituals that feel inevitable. The kind people don’t just buy — they believe in.</p>
      <p>Our first is Beau — a sculptural bottle reimagining hydration as a luxury ritual.</p>
      <p>Born from aesthetic instinct, built with founders like you.</p>
      <p>And this is just the start.</p>
      <p>From beauty to wellness, lifestyle to objects of obsession — every future brand will be shaped by the people inside this collective.</p>
      <p>You’ll have a say. A stake. A space to co-create.</p>
      <p>We don’t chase trends. We create culture.</p>
      <p>Built slowly. Built beautifully.</p>
      <p>Built to last.</p>

      <h2>Who We Back</h2>
      <p>We don’t hire. We don’t manage. We don’t take applications.</p>
      <p>We back people who move differently — who lead with taste, intuition, and intention.</p>
      <p>You don’t need millions of followers. You need vision.</p>
      <p>You don’t need to perform. You need to feel aligned.</p>
      <p>If you’re here, it’s because we’ve seen something in you.</p>
      <p>This isn’t another paid promo. It’s a seat at the table.</p>
      <p>MODELS Inc is a space for founders — not just influencers.</p>
      <p>And if you know, you know.</p>
